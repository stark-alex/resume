: *Associate Principal Engineer*
  __Nov 2011 - May 2015__
: *Software Engineering Manager*
  __Sept 2009 - Nov 2011__
: *Software Engineer/Architect*
  __May 2006 - Sept 2009__

Lead multiple teams of engineers in technical leadership, direct engineering management, and product management roles.  These teams were responsible for the core platform upon which Cerner Millenniumâ€™s services and user applications are built.  Cerner Millennium is used by 500+ Medical Facilities and consists of 1000+ services and 70+ user facing applications.

* Plan, design, and drive the future direction of the architecture.
* Code changes ranging from minor defect fixes to broad architecture changes requiring iterative planning.  While ensuring delivery of iterative value.
* Design development process to increase developer productivity resulting in a run-rate defect backlog while continuing to meet the compliance.  Allowing the team to focus on enhancing the architecture and providing value to the business.
* Coordinated the other development teams to ensure the platform is implementing the correct features to meet our consumers' needs.
* Working directly with the support organization and clients ensuring prompt issue resolution with an emphasis on strong troubleshooting skills, system performance, and scalability.
* Drive best practices across a 1,000+ engineer development org.

### Highlights {#highlights}

#### Consolidated Service Platform

Set vision and defined the plan for consolidating the varied service platform implementations Millennium accumulated over the last 20+ years in both Product Management and Architect roles.  This is a multi-year and multi-team effort.  One key to the plan's success has been to ensure value is delivered as progress towards the final goal state is made.  Allowing for that goal state to change as knowledge, experience and technology change over time.

* Created iterative and agile plan to converge the Millennium service platform implementations to build a streamlined simplified system while providing value to our clients and internal consumers iteratively.
* Consolidate the six Millennium Service deployment patterns to two (Centrally Deployed and Package Delivered) to reduce the complexity exposed to operations and service developers.
* Ensure platform supports central deployment for all service types if/when the business needs arise.
* Abstracted numerous developer tools and processes for defining and deploying services to a single process.  Maximizing efficiency of service developers and minimizing time to onboard new engineers.
* Drove consolidation of how various services API types are called from the many consumer workload deployments and languages.

The following are examples of iterative value provided as part of this effort:

* Delivered enhancements to the way the underlying queuing system is deployed to reduce licence cost by $1M+ year once rolled out, while also adding resiliency to the overall system.
* Completely modernized the native service development continuous integration system.
* Designed updated Java service assembly processes to minimize impact of platform update adoption to service owner teams.
  
#### Event Driven Architecture Platform

Since it's inception Millennium was built on a service oriented architecture.  As more complex workflows were discovered it became apparent incorporating Event Driven patterns is vital to enable developers to implement those  workflows efficiently.

* Responsible for building out the product vision and architectural design to introduce an event backbone into the existing system.
* Evaluated technologies for fit as well as coordinating with dozens of Millennium teams to ensure the design meets their use cases.
* Designed patterns for reliably delivered events from the existing RDBMS based system into Apache Kafka while avoiding 2-phase commit concerns.
* Planned implementation plan weighing the vast use cases possibilities based on MVP and short-term needs.

#### Package to Cloud Migration

One of 4 company-wide architects selected to provide guidance and technical feasibility analysis for running Cerner's Millennium EMR in multiple public clouds. Embraced IaaS/IaC concepts in a true DevOps environment to ensure timelines were met. Explored further options such as alternate deployments of the technology stack and assessment of cloud services for replacing expensive enterprise technologies (e.g. IBM MQ)

#### Continuous Integration C++ Services

Replaced existing proprietary make-based build system with Gradle adding integrated automated testing. Enabling developers across Cerner to produce higher quality code more quickly.  Leveraged Docker and Kubernetes to replace existing package delivered deployments.  Aligning with Cerner's more modern web services reducing the time to deliver fixes and enhancements to our clients.

#### Technology Modernization Projects

Held leadership positions in several company wide technology updates. These projects reduced total cost of ownership of Millennium while modernizing the code base and reducing technical debt.  Designed uplift processes to produce the desired outcome with minimal dev effort ensuring these broad and in some cases automated changes were deployed to client environments with minimal risk.  
__Projects:__ 64-bit port of code base, Linux port of UNIX code base, VC++6 to VC++ 10 Migration, Visual Basic to C# Migration.
